<p>You can use <em>Rename-It!</em> in a batch to provide an automated advanced
renaming.</p>

<p>Define some filters and save them. You should add some comments to help you
remember what the filters do. To rename some files/folders using those preset
filters, execute:</p>

<p align="center"><code>RENAMEIT /X filter_file path [/R] [/A] [path [/R] [/A] [...]] [/LOG log_file [/V]]</code></p>
<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<td><strong>/X filter_file</strong></td>
		<td>Path to your saved filter file (*.rit).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>path</strong></td>
		<td>Path to a file or a folder to be renamed (can contain wildcards characters ? or *). The <b>/R</b> and <b>/A</b> are options that can be put after the <b>path</b>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>/R</strong></td>
		<td>Include the folders and sub-folders of the previous <b>path</b>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>/A</strong></td>
		<td>Include all files, even the system files of the previous <b>path</b>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>/LOG log_file</strong></td>
		<td>Don't stop on warnings or errors but log them in a file named <b>log_file</b> instead.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong>/V</strong></td>
		<td>Also include files correctly renamed in the log file.</td>
	</tr>
