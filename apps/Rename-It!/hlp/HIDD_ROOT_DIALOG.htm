<p><strong>Rename-It!</strong> can rename many files, folders or even a full
path a file using renaming filters. It may sound complicated at first, but
after a few times you'll be able to rename files in seconds and in only a few
clicks.</p>
<p>To start renaming some files or folders, open the Windows Explorer,
<strong>select a bunch of files or folders</strong>, right click on them to
open the classical context menu, and choose <em>Rename-It!</em>. All files,
folders, and the files in those folders will be added to the files list of
<em>Rename-It!</em>. This list, visible at the bottom of the main window,
contains the files and folders to be renamed. Alternatively you can
drag&amp;drop files/folders to the <em>Rename-It!</em> window.</p>
<p>Once you have a set of files/folders to be renamed you have to define what
part you would like to rename. Select <strong>what part to rename</strong> by
highlighting it in the "<em>Rename what</em>" text box. The filters will only
affect that part and warn you if you attempt anything that would compromize
this.</p>
<p>To <strong>rename files'</strong> names only, start by selecting "Filename"
in the "<em>Rename what</em>" box. Then add <a href=
"Renaming%20filter.html">renaming filters</a>. Each filter will be applyed to
each file name (and only to the files' names) sequentially. The top filter is
the first executed (see <a href="Renaming%20flowchart.html">flowchart</a>). The
filtered part name will then be passed to the other filters, if any.</p>
<p>To <strong>rename folders</strong> only it's the same procedure than
renaming files but you select "\..\Folders\" in the "<em>Rename what</em>" box.
Note that the files in the folders disappear from the preview to only display
unique folder names.</p>
<p>Each time you add/modify/delete a filter the <strong>preview list</strong>
will show a <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> renaming preview.</p>
<p>Once you are ready, just press the "<em>Rename</em>" button. If problem
occur a window will appear for you to correct them before the renaming start.
After that, just close <em>Rename-It!</em>.</p>
