<p>To create even more advanced filters or to execute some actions at specific
moments during the renaming, you can use <em>External Processor</em> filters.
This filter execute an external software and can read the output of that
software to rename the file.</p>
<p>The most powerfull use is for more for developpers. Create or use&nbsp;a
console application that takes the file name as argument and outputs some text
that can later be used to rename the file in <em>Rename-It!</em>. The output of
your application could be for example the meta-title of the file, the size of
an image, whatever you like. You may further use r<em>enaming filters</em> to
clean the output.</p>
<p>Another use is to execute some actions on the files at specific times. For
example to run a VIM script, flip an image...</p>
<p>Note that those filters are not executed for the preview by default: They
are only executed when the renaming really happen. If you check the "Execute
for the preview" box, the filter will be executed for any filtering
preview.</p>
