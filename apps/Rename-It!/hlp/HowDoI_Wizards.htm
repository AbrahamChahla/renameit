<Title>Doing simple tasks (with wizards)</Title>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<p>Most of the tasks can be done by using the wizards. Sometimes you have to use two wizards (or the same twice) to achieve what you want. All the wizards
help you to create a <a href="_topic_not_found.html">Renamer</a> filter for a specific task.</p>

<p>To use a wizard, click on the arrow right of the the "<em>Renamer</em>"
button, or left click on that button. Most wizards are self explanatory.</p>

<p>Even if they help you to create the filter, they don't replace it: Once it
is created, if you want to modify the filter you'll only be able to modify the more complex generated <a href=
"_topic_not_found.html">Renamer</a> filter.</p>

<p>After some practice you should be able to understand the full <a href=
"_topic_not_found.html">Renamer</a> filter and use it to create more
advanced renaming rules.</p>
