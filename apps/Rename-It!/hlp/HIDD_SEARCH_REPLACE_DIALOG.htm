<p>The <strong>Renamer</strong> filter is the root of <em>Rename-It!</em>. It's
an advanced search and replace function with advanced tools like regexp,
enumerations, ID3 Tags, case changer.</p>
<p>The basic function is to enter a search string in the search box, and a
replacement string in the replacement box. Each time the string is found in the
part behind renamed, it's replaced. You may check different search or
replacement options and use more advanced search &amp; replace with
<em>wildcards</em> or <em>regexp</em>.</p>
<p>For <strong>wildcards</strong>, put a ? to match any single character or *
to match any character(s) (0 or more)&nbsp;in the search box. Example:
Searching "my_*_name" would match a file named "my_file_name". In the
replacement box you can also use *; it'll be replaced by the matched string.
Example: Replacing by "new_*_name" in our previous example would finally give
"new_file_name".</p>
<p><strong>Regular expressions</strong>, aka <em>RegExp</em>, are some also
commonly used expressions to search &amp; replace, much more advanced than
<em>wildcards</em>. See for example: <a href=

<p>The <em>Renaming Filter</em> can also <a href="_topic_not_found.html">change
the case</a>, <a href="_topic_not_found.html">read ID3 Tags</a> from audio
files, or <a href="_topic_not_found.html">create
enumerations</a>.</p>
